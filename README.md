# Behavioral Modeling of Phase-Locked Loop using Deep Learning

## Overview
A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is a feedback control system that synchronizes an output signal's phase and frequency with a reference signal. This project focuses on learning the PLL’s dynamic behavior using data-driven deep learning models.

This project focuses on developing a behavioral model of a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) using deep learning techniques.
The goal is to approximate the input-output behavior of a PLL using data-driven models instead of detailed circuit-level simulations.

This project is developed as part of the MathWorks MATLAB & Simulink Challenge.

## Objectives
- Design and simulate a basic PLL using Simulink
- Generate input-output datasets from the PLL
- Train a deep learning model to learn PLL behavior
- Compare predicted outputs with actual simulation results

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Deep Learning Toolbox
